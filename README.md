# HTML & CSS Code Refactor
I was tasked with changing the HTML and CSS so that the website would meet accessibility standards.
I did the following:

- Made sure semantic HTML elements could be found throughout the source code.
- Changed the HTML elements  so it follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Added image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes.
- Made sure heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Made sure that title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.
